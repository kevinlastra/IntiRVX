# IntiRVX

## Introduction

This project aims to implement all the knowledge on CPU microarchitecture acquire through the years of internships and schooling.

IntiRVX is a 5 stage architecture with a limited Out of Order implementation, all developed in SystemVerilog.

## Current Objectives

- Validation of the RISC-V base extension (RV32I).
- Add extension M, A, C.
- Implement static branch predictor.
- Add the needed configuration to have both 32 and 64 bits architecture.
- Build basic system for implementing peripherals and memories.
- Add Vivado synthesis and implementation.
