# IntiRVX

## Introduction

This project aims to implement all the knowledge on CPU microarchitecture acquire through the years.

The first project of IntiRVX is a 5 staged CPU architecture with a limited Out of Order implementation.

## Current Objectives

Here I list all short and long-term objectives of IntiRVX project:

- Validation of the RISC-V base extension (RV32I).
- Implement static branch predictor.
- Add extension M, A, C, F and D.
- Add the needed configuration to have both 32 and 64 bits on the same RTL code(IntiRV32 and IntiRV64).
- Build basic system for implementing peripherals and memories.
- Include S and U mode, and implement a MMU.
- Add Vivado synthesis and implementation.
- Build fully OoO implementation(IntiRVX_OoO)
- Build a Superscalarimplementation of the IntiRVX
